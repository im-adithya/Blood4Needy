                        <p>Hi, My name is Lakshya Madhav Goyal and I am the founder and CEO of Blood4Needy- an initiative under Lend2Mend foundation.<br /><br />
                    This all started when I was just 10 years old. My father organized a blood donation camp and recorded highest ever units of blood donations in a single day which was massive 1000 units of donation.<br /><br />
                    Soon after the camp my father started getting calls almost daily from regular working hours to late night or early mornings.<br /><br />
                    This incident really shook me and again I saw the rising need for the blood as the Covid-19 pandemic hit the world. The donors had just vanished. And blood is becoming scarce which also gave me another reason to think that what if another pandemic happens in which blood loss takes place?<br /><br />
                    I instantly saw this uprising need and I chose to build an online platform so that the impact is not just limited to Gwalior or Madhya Pradesh or even India, my aim is to scale it to even higher heights by making it the largest network of blood donors - a step towards a bright future where no one dies dueto lack of blood.<br /><br />
                    Today, We have addressed over 247+ blood requests with a network of 700+ blood donors and with the trust of over 5000 people and that too by bootstrapping it, I have only realized how big the issue is and also the huge impact that Blood4Needy can create.</p><br /><br />
